/*Paris, November 2012*/

A lil experiment to show off power of coffeescript along with sass.

Goal : build a dynamic grid of characters whom lines would randmoly move on the x and y axis.

Bonus :
Changes in the css styles among the moves
On the fly coffeescript/sass output ?

/* First update */

From here i'm wondering if the best path would be to drop the alphabet and go for something less typish but more aesthetic:
Bullet grid for example with change of all colors on hover, random generation by coffeescript and pre-processed gradient with sass


/* Second Update */

Evolved to an hsl color grid

50- sass lines transformed into 6000+
